      TODO CHECKLIST
1. Add en pessant move in Pawn
2. Add King threat logic before moving pieces
3. Clean up code in finished files (Pieces,Color etc) :
consistent naming, comments, dependencies
4. Change makefile to compile only changed files and dependencies
      CONSIDERATION_LIST
1. May need to write better include statements which take into account threat
   relative path of the file in the project.
   Example: #include "pieces/bishop.h"
   In that way we could probably get rid of the -I flags while building
